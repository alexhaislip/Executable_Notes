1) Create a new text file with a .sh extension.

2) Add #!/bin/bash to the top of it.

3) Add lines that youâ€™d normally type at the command line.

#!/bin/bash

5git add .

7git commit -m "Updates"
8
9git push

4) At the command line, run chmod u+x YourScriptFileName.sh

I ran chmod u+x deploy.sh to make mine executable.

5) Run it whenever you need!
Now, whenever I deploy changes to my website, I run ./deploy.sh and boom. Done.
